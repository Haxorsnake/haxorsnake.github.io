<p class="calibre2">“It’s also possible that I’m just overthinking things,” Solewind said with a laugh.</p><p class="calibre2">“Mm.”</p><p class="calibre2">“There may be many things in the Archaeus region unknown to us.” None of them dared claim they knew everything about this place.</p><p class="calibre2">Did the mortals of the Archaeus region go to a Daolord’s estate-world after ascending, or did they go into some other special place? None of them were certain. Still, they had to remain vigilant. Given their current level of power, battles against Daolords were still quite risky for them.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s go,” Prince Greatjoy sent. Ji Ning and the others re-entered his flying vessel, then quietly and stealthily departed from this enormous continent and continued their journey via teleportation through the Archaeus region.</p><p class="calibre2">One year. Ten years. A hundred years…</p><p class="calibre2">The five of them continued to advance carefully. The Archaeus region truly was the core of this entire alternate universe, the place from which everything had first arisen. This place was filled with countless marvels and dangers as well as quite a few precious treasures. Ning’s group, however, didn’t dare to be too greedy. They did their best to avoid as many danger zones as they could, but they still encountered trouble on quite a few occasions.</p><p class="calibre2">Roughly 1308 years after they had entered the Archaeus region, they encountered an extremely powerful Daolord! They had come incredibly close to dying that time!</p><p class="calibre2">They had been teleporting through space using their flying vessel when all of a sudden, they discovered a green-robed Daolord had suddenly appeared a few billion kilometers up ahead of them. This Daolord was quite ugly, with white eyebrows hanging down all the way to his chest. He was leisurely strolling through the emptiness of space, but when he saw Ning’s flying vessel appear a look of murder appeared in his eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">That glare alone gave all five of them a sensation of tremendous danger.</p><p class="calibre2">“Leave right away.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Flee!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Quick!”</p><p class="calibre2">All five of them could sense death impending.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ahh!” Prince Greatjoy furiously sent his vessel into an immediate teleport. Swoosh! Right after his vessel disappeared, a sharp thread-like streak of light lashed through the empty space where the vessel had been.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph.” The green-robed Daolord’s gaze was cold as he relased his godsense to inspect the surrounding area of a trillion kilometers. “They ran quite quickly. I wonder which master they are apprenticed to.” The green-robed Daolord let out a cold snort, then walked away and disappeared from the scene.</p><p class="calibre2">Although that interaction had been a very brief one, Ning’s group remained terrified by the memory of it.</p><p class="calibre2">“That Daolord was definitely at the Verge of the Daomerge! Although Daolords are quite rare here in the Archaeus region, there’s still more of them than World-level cultivators. Many World-level cultivators have entered then exited the Archaeus region, with almost none of them actually staying here for an extended period of time! Given how vast the Archaeus region is, we have a much higher chance of running into Daolords than into other World-level cultivators.” Solewind shook his head. “Still, I never would’ve thought we would run into a Daolord just a thousand years after entering the Archaeus region. Worse, it was a shameless Daolord who immediately moved to attack us and steal our Archaeus medallions. Thank goodness brother Greatjoy was here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That old bastard was very powerful. If I had been just a bit slower, we wouldn’t have been able to escape.” Prince Greatjoy also felt fear at what had nearly happened.</p><p class="calibre2">“It was all thanks to you, brother Greatjoy.” Ning was still petrified as well. If they had actually been forced to fight… even though Ning had those four guardian golems protecting him, there was no way he would’ve been able to defeat a Verge-level Daolord.</p><p class="calibre2">That near-brush with death had caused their souls and truesouls to all quiver with terror.</p><p class="calibre2">……</p><p class="calibre2">To be in a ‘relaxed’ state or to be in a ‘tense’ state where you straddled the line between life and death were two completely separate concepts.</p><p class="calibre2">You might spend multiple chaos cycles in a relaxed state without making any improvements, but just one or two life-and-death adventures might be enough to result in dramatic gains in strength! To live a peaceful life for countless years, or to straddle the line between life and death as you reached for greater glory and greater heights? Clearly, the majority of cultivators chose the latter.</p><p class="calibre2">More than 2800 years had passed since Ning’s group had entered the Archaeus region.</p><p class="calibre2">……</p><p class="calibre2">Boom!</p><p class="calibre2">“Charge!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s charge through!”</p><p class="calibre2">Ning’s group of five were all aboard their flying vessel, using all their power to resist.</p><p class="calibre2">They were surrounded by countless spatial tempests, and their flying vessel was being tossed about by the spatial storms like an ordinary vessel might be tossed about by giant waves. They were completely unable to fight back as the spatial tempests pressed them forwards nonstop.</p><p class="calibre2">Ning’s group was still trying their best to resist, and Ning himself sent out an enormous streak of sword-light to tear a spatial tempest apart.</p><p class="calibre2">Firesurge sent out enormous waves of water to crash out against those spatial tempests.</p><p class="calibre2">Skyfire Brightshore had been growing noticeably more powerful ever since he had entered this alternate universe. He was now working alongside Firesurge, and the two were combining their skills in fire and water.</p><p class="calibre2">Greatjoy and Solewind were doing their best as well.</p><p class="calibre2">Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p class="calibre2">The flying vessel was still being buffeted and tossed about by the spatial tempests.</p><p class="calibre2">“Won’t work. We can’t charge through.” Prince Greatjoy shook his head. “The difference in power between us and these spatial tempests is too great. These spatial tempests are simply too violent. Even my control over spacetime won’t be enough to calm them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ugh.” Firesurge frowned.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s just go with the flow, then.” Solewind chuckled. “This isn’t exactly the first time we ran into something like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ning nodded as well, then laughed, “These spatial tempests won’t always maintain such a high level of strength. If we just follow the flows, eventually we’ll reach a spot where things calm down.”</p><p class="calibre2">The Archaeus region was filled with many dangers, and they had encountered spatial tempests on quite a few occasions by now. Although Ning, Solewind, and the others all had certain trump cards they could use, these naturally occurring phenomena really weren’t worth the cost.</p><p class="calibre2">They ended up following the flows of the spatial tempests for nine more months.</p><p class="calibre2">“The spatial tempests are actually growing stronger and stronger.” Prince Greatjoy continued to helm the flying vessel through the storms, seeking a relatively easier ‘path’ for them to traverse.</p><p class="calibre2">“Everyone, look over there!” Prince Greatjoy suddenly called out.</p><p class="calibre2">“Land.” Ning and the others turned to stare as well, only to see an utterly enormous continent hanging in the void just past the spatial tempests.</p><p class="calibre2">“There’s actually land here? Hopefully this continent will have actual people living on it.” Ning and the others revealed looks of delight.</p><p class="calibre2">A short while later, Ning and the others all descended upon the great continent. The edges of this continent were surrounded by strange whirlpools of power that continuously weakened the spatial storms that swept towards the continent. By the time they made it a few billion kilometers into the heart of the continent, things were completely calm.</p><p class="calibre2">“An ancient, major power has passed by this continent before.” Ning’s group advanced through a desolate desert. This place was still considered as being part of the ‘border regions’ of this continent. The environs were quite harsh and not suitable for life.</p><p class="calibre2">Heartlord Solewind raised his head and stared off into the distance. “I can dimly sense that this entire continent is covered by an enormous formation which is diverting the power of those spatial tempests. This formation must’ve been left behind by a major power.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, a major power has been here.” Prince Greatjoy stared towards a place roughly a billion kilometers away. “This continent is filled with countless living beings. It is very likely that this continent holds a spacetime transfer array.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Haha, it’ll be much easier for us to leave if we can move through a spacetime transfer array.” Ning laughed.</p><p class="calibre2">“Remember that time from five hundred years ago, when we were trapped in that sea of fire and unable to escape? In the end, we discovered that there was actually a continent located deep within the sea of fire.” Skyfire Brightshore couldn’t help but reminisce about this. “That continent was also filled with many living beings, and it also had a spacetime transfer array. It even had an estate left behind by a Daolord. Thankfully, that Daolord had left long ago, and so we were able to easily enter the spacetime transfer array and reach a different area. It actually shortened our journey considerably.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ning and the others all nodded. By now, they had spent nearly three thousand years in the Archaeus region, and they had accumulated a great deal of experience.</p><p class="calibre2">The Archaeus region was filled with countless continents that were in turn filled with many living beings. Small continents were generally ten billion kilometers in size, while larger ones could be a trillion kilometers in size! There were often traces of ancient major powers having passed through these places, albeit very few of them would actually set up residence. There was no point in living alongside ordinary mortals, after all.</p><p class="calibre2">However, virtually every single continent with living beings on it had a spacetime transfer array!</p><p class="calibre2">Ning’s group, however, didn’t dare to randomly use those arrays without doing some careful investigations. They’d rather continuously teleport through the Archaeus region than accidentally run into a reclusive Daolord who was residing within one of those continents!</p><p class="calibre2">“I hope things work out this time,” Ning sent mentally.</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry, Darknorth. Even if there are Daolords residing in this continent, Daolords often go into closed-door meditation sessions that last a million years or more. We’ll move in and depart immediately. There’s no way we’ll be unlucky enough to run into one,” Greatjoy chortled.</p><p class="calibre2">“Just be careful, everyone. Don’t randomly send out your godsense to search this place,” Solewind warned.</p><p class="calibre2">If you swept a region with godsense, you might be able to discover a Daolord… but that Daolord would also discover you!</p><p class="calibre2">……</p><p class="calibre2">Ning’s group of five advanced through the continent, quickly reaching a place which was bustling with life and activity.</p><p class="calibre2">This place was a city known as Thousand Mountains, a place where the eight major sects of the region all recruited disciples from.</p><p class="calibre2">In the city of Thousand Mountains resided an old freak known as ‘Old Demon Qixiu’. He truly was the number one expert of this region, superior to all others in the eight major sects. However, he was a very low-key figure who very few people knew about.</p><p class="calibre2">“Patriarch.” As the Old Demon walked out of his room and through his estate, quite a few servants and retainers would call out to him with respect when they saw him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ugh. This world places enormous restrictions on my power.” The Old Demon’s gaze drifted off into the distance as he stared at the mountain ranges outside the city of Thousand Mountains. “And yet, I really just can’t bear to leave…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh?” The Old Demon’s face suddenly turned pale. Five figures had suddenly appeared next to the lake nearby him. They were Ning, Solewind, and the others.</p><p class="calibre2"><br class="p"/></p><hr class="calibre8"/><p class="calibre2"><br class="p"/></p>
